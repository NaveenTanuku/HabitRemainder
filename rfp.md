 Used together, you’ll be able to develop healthy habits with ease. If you’re falling behind, the app will send you a reminder, and keep you on target.
 
If you’re looking for inspiration, the application comes with over pre-designed habits to get you started. One of the most appealing things is the beautifully designed and eye catching interface.

The app is quick and easy to use, so you’ll be able to start developing great habits right away. If you plan to complete a set number of tasks for a specific date, the app calculates if you’re on track to complete it on time, enabling you to tailor your habits around your goals.

When day starts...

1. User gets some pre-defined habits where he gets remainder to complete it.
2. Some habits can be customized on date which reminds user to complete within the time.
3. The completation of habits gives credit to the user which motivates him to be healthy with ease.
